ActionBarSherlock Plugin: Maps
==============================

This plugin provides support for the Google API `MapView` widget through an
additional base activity, `FragmentMapActivity`. Your application must adhere
to all of the regular requirements of implementing the [Google Map View][1].

By using `FragmentMapActivity` you are afforded the use of fragments, loaders,
and the action bar--including support for using a `MapView` within a fragment.
You can find examples of these implementations in the 'demos' sample.
